I am currently a research intern at [SymLab](http://symlab.ust.hk/) at HKUST, supervised by Paul Li. One of my most recent tasks is developing a web based application to implement the text selection in Microsoft Hololens which is controlled by the smart phone.

I have several research experiences which are concentrated on Machine Learning, Natural Language processing(Chinese mostly), HCI(application for VR/AR devices, proficient in web), Distributed System(model designing and model checking), Computer Network(network programming), algorithm(interested in dynamic programming and recurrence problems).

Recently I am wishing for a machine learning research opportunity, it is expected in the fields of economics/marketing/real application.
