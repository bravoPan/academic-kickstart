abstract: This project is based on a P2P websocket that could connect MS HoloLens and any smart phone (with major popular browser). The main goal is to implement the head-tail text selection in HoloLens. The project is under development, the paper submission has been accepted into PerComp2020.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Reliability of two indoor positioning system (IPS) frameworks is studied in this paper. The experimental results show that TPT (Triangulation Positioning Technology) will make an inevitable influence to the system reliability due to the number restriction of the positioning antenna;
