abstract: This project is adapt from the book [Programming Collective Intelligence: Building Smart Web 2.0 Applications](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Collective-Intelligence-Building-Applications/dp/0596529325), while the example codes&resources are expired. So I designed a self-studied API thoroughly and made the clustering algorithm in total Chinese environment. The exampled API I made is based on web scrawling from [ZhiHu](https://www.zhihu.com/), the source code could be viewed from [here](https://github.com/bravoPan/collective_programming-/tree/master/chapter3). The basic algorithm is clustering, with hierarchical and K-Mean Clusterings. I finally made a simple application on a Chinese movie website (like IMDB) [douban](https://github.com/bravoPan/collective_programming-/tree/master/chapter3), which could recommend the books for the people who have the similar preference.
