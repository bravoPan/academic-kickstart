abstract: This project is introduced by a mathematical modeling question, the full question could be found [here](https://bravopan.github.io/2018_ICM_Problem_D.pdf). More concisely, we are given a task to optimize the Tesla charge station in U.S., with respect to the city population, charger specification, car types and etc.. Our solution could be checked on this [page](https://github.com/bravoPan/2018_MCM-ICM). The solution could be generic as a total solution for all electric vehicles, and we also explore the possibility to be applied in Korea, Australia.
