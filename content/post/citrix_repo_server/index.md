title: Raspbian OS Repo Purge, Citrix
subtitle: A Company Customized Package Repository designed based on Raspbian.

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The proposal is to maintain a customized repo by Citrix which contains all Raspbian binary packages and has the capabilities to sync with Raspbian regularly and store our own Debian binary packages. The meaning of our project is to make it easier for WSH(Worksapce Hub) users to install the packages only by receiving several commandas. And we would optimize this project by adding a Cache Server.
